# Lamellibrachia genome
## Abstract


## Introduction
![](../figures/Picture1.png) 
**Fig 1.** *Lamellibrachia* from seep localities in Gulf of Mexico. 

## Methods

### Biological materials.
Adult *Lamellibrachia* specimens were collected from from seep localities in the Mississippi Canyon at 754 m depth in Gulf of Mexico (N 28°11.58', W 89°47.94'), using the R/V Seward Johnson and Johnson Sea Link in October 2009. All samples were frozen at 80˚C following collection. [@de2006cafe]
